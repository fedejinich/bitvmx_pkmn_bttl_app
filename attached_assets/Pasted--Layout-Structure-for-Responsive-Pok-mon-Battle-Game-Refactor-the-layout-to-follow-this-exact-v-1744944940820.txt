# ðŸ§± Layout Structure for Responsive PokÃ©mon Battle Game

Refactor the layout to follow this exact vertical structure and make it **fully responsive**, with all elements properly aligned, occupying the **entire vertical screen (`100vh`)**:

---

### âœ… Structure (top to bottom):

1. **Title (Game Logo)**
   - Display at the top.
   - Centered horizontally.
   - Scales responsively on smaller screens.

2. **Status Bars**
   - Show two panels side by side (or stacked on mobile):
     - Left: playerâ€™s PokÃ©mon (name, level, HP)
     - Right: Charizard (name, level, HP)
   - Keep sizing and alignment consistent.

3. **Arena (Battle Area)**
   - Center this block.
   - Left: PokÃ©ball or selected player PokÃ©mon.
   - Right: Charizard.
   - Both sprites must use the **exact same fixed height** (e.g., `120px`) and be vertically aligned on the same ground level.
   - Ensure consistent spacing between them.

4. **Message Box**
   - Positioned **fixed** or **absolute bottom** within the full container (like a Game Boy).
   - Must **always be visible**, without moving or shifting the layout.
   - Only its **text content should change dynamically**.

5. **Action Button**
   - Appears **directly below the message box**.
   - Should be responsive and touch-friendly.
   - Should not overlap with the message box or go offscreen.

### ðŸ“± Responsiveness Notes

- On **mobile**:
  - Stack content where necessary.
  - Reduce padding and font size to preserve layout integrity.
  - Ensure all sprites remain visible without scroll.

- On **desktop**:
  - Use flex or grid to align items horizontally.
  - Allow more spacing and larger font/sprite sizes.

### ðŸ’… Style Requirements

- Use `height: 100vh` on the main wrapper.
- Use Tailwind utility classes like `flex-col`, `justify-between`, and `items-center` to vertically distribute space.
- Apply `image-rendering: pixelated` to all sprites.
- Set consistent height (e.g., `h-[120px]`) for all PokÃ©mon and PokÃ©ball sprites.
- Remove any inconsistent margins/paddings that break alignment.
- Add `overflow-hidden` if necessary to prevent scroll flickering.

### ðŸŽ¯ Goal

Make the game feel like a **real retro PokÃ©mon battle UI**, pixel-perfect, with no layout shifts or overflow. All elements must snap to their correct positions on both desktop and mobile.
